            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe great Deſign of God in this World, is to exerciſe man; and the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of man, is to glorifie God, who hath provided the Touch-ſtone of his Word to try our hearts by, and the <hi>Balance</hi> of his works to weigh our Lives in: So much ſtrength as we have in a day of temptation, ſo ſtrong we are; and ſince Temptation is for our Probation, we have as much cauſe to bleſs God for our ſupport under Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
<pb facs="tcp:65689:3"/>
as for our deliverance from try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: It is true, Satan hath his <hi>Sieve,</hi> and his aim is to ſeperate the Wheat from the Chaff; to give life to our ſins, by the death of our Graces; but God hath his Fan in his hand, and his deſign is to ſeperate the Chaff from the Wheat, to give life to our Graces by the death of our ſins.</p>
            <p>I muſt acknowledge, That God hath lately put into your hands a bitter <hi>Cup</hi> to drink off (in the deceaſe of your Vertuous and Beloved Conſort) onely this I preſume doth ſupport you, That your eyes are opened to ſee that it was of your Fathers mingling: This affliction is a ſharp <hi>Arrow,</hi> but it is ſhot out of a ſweet hand; <hi>ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſagitta, ex dulci manu Dei</hi> (as
<pb facs="tcp:65689:3"/>
the Father ſpeaks) How excellent a thing is it, when Gods <hi>Rod</hi> is upon our backs, to have our hands upon our mouthes, and not to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur? While unbelief commenceth an Action againſt, and complains of the heavy hand of God to the World, for us to complain rather of our own evil hearts to God? Your experience (Sir, I truſt) in Gods <hi>School,</hi> hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted you with the Equity of his Diſcipline and Pedagogy. Oh! What an advantage have we over Satan, when we underſtand the intent, and and poſſeſs the fruit of every Croſs; when we can ſee our Laſhes to be our Leſſons, our Corrections to be our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, our <hi>Croſſes</hi> to be the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners of our Corruptions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65689:4"/>It was an Heavenly Prayer of him that ſaid, <hi>Lord, I do not deſire that the Burthen ſhould be taken off, but that I might have ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhoulders to bear it:</hi> And an Heroick Experience of him that ſaid, <hi>If any man would ride poſt to Heaven, let him get up upon the Croſs.</hi> The truth is, every affliction is Gods Meſſenger, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of his Meſſengers have their Errand to deliver: The Rod muſt be heard, or the Word will never be felt: Though all that are corrected are not Gods children, yet all that are Gods children are corrected. Afflictions are favors, and therefore when God threatens that he will ſhew mercy no more, he threatens that he will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
<pb facs="tcp:65689:4"/>
no more. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is joyned to Idols, let him alone. Lord, rather (let every gracious heart ſay) let thine hand be laid on me, then that I ſhould be caſt out of thy hand; rather frown on me, then that thou ſhouldſt turn thy Face from, and not look on me.</p>
            <p>But the great Advantage of our tryal, is to come; here the Language of the rod is eaſie and plain, but the <hi>Dialect</hi> of that Language is hard and difficult to be known; conformity and ſelf-denyal, are indiſputably the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every blow, but we are diſpoſed to miſconter Providence in Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; what God intends onely for our exerciſe, we pretend is done out of his anger: And therefore where the Text is obſcure, we muſt be wary in writing
<pb facs="tcp:65689:5"/>
               <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries,</hi> we <hi>muſt take heed of turning his Reubarb into Ratsbane, by reading wrath where God never wrote it:</hi> There will come a time, when God will interpret his own minde, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us, not onely in the Regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and juſtice of his Rods, but in the Reaſon and ſuitableneſs of them; why we are almoſt burned and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, while others were but ſinged; why he drew ſo much blood from us, more then from others that ſeemed more exorbitant: God loves not to be ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like the Bee, he exhibits honey freely, but he ſtings upon provocation; his wiſdom and our neceſsity, weigh and preſcribe every drop of gall that is put into our Cups, and every laſh
<pb facs="tcp:65689:5"/>
of the Rod that is laid on our backs. A Cordial is fitter for this man, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſive fitter for another: Such a Chriſtian will be wakned by the light of a Candle, another ſtands in need of a Clap of Thunder: How ſweet is it to juſtifie God, when he condemns us? At laſt day we ſhall ſay, The Lord knew our diſtemper, and he let us blood in the principal Vein; if we had not periſhed, we had periſhed: His Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine melted us, his Hammer brake us. Bleſſed affliction! that made us ſee more uglineſſe and emptineſſe in the Creature, and more excellency in God, that weaned our affections from the world, and occaſioned our more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts of Eternity.</p>
            <p>It may ſatisfie us, That God
<pb facs="tcp:65689:6"/>
dealeth with his, as the <hi>Perſians,</hi> I take it, do with the offending children of their Princes; they correct their <hi>Royal Garments</hi> in publick, but let their Perſons go free; our Bodies are beaten, and our Souls are bettered: Here we muſt be poliſhed by Tryals, and hewn by Hammers, and hereafter we ſhall be laid into Gods Building; <hi>Nunc foris per flagella tundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, ut intus in Templum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini diſponamur,</hi> Afflictions are the fruit of his Wiſdom, Repentance our fruit of his Afflictions: The Lord grant that all our ſtorms may drive us nigher to our Harbor. I ſhould hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave excuſe for this freedom, but that I know your Ingenuity, and that your condition requireth ſupport; and

            <p>In the work of a Chriſtian we have,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Something Implyed: It is ſuppoſed, That thoſe that die in the Lord, do firſt live to the Lord; For as it is impoſſible for one that lives well to die ill, ſo it is impoſſible for one that lives ill to die well; for on that to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65689:8"/>
the laſt lives to the Divel, to die to the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Something Expreſſed: They are ſuch as die in the Lord: Some make a difference, between <hi>dying for,</hi> and <hi>dying in</hi> the Lord, as if that belonged onely to Martyrs, this to all true Profeſſors:<note place="margin">Martyres hic intelligi conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus ſolos vero negamus. <hi>Gorhan.</hi>
               </note> But the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is, That when Gods children have done their work, they go to bed, their Luſts die in them, and they themſelves die in the Lord, <hi>as Children in their Fathers arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As we have the work, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we have the wages, or rather <hi>reward</hi> of Chriſtians: And that 1. Generally: They are ſaid to be bleſſed, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord:</hi> They are bleſſed in Hope while they live, and bleſſed in Poſſeſſion when they die: As a Chriſtian cannot be fully happy before death, ſo he cannot at all be miſerable after death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Particularly and Punctually: And that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively:</hi> Becauſe they reſt from their Labors; their labors in ſuffering, their labors under ſin, the labors of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and ſubjection unto Temptations: The World was their Tempeſtuous Sea, Heaven
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65689:8"/>
is their Port and Harbor; the Earth was the place of their working, Heaven the place of their reſting: <hi>In portu navigunt quare ſopor feſſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſitively,</hi> and their works do follow them: Though they leave the world, yet they leave not their works behinde them: The authority and warrant of all this is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. This Oracle is not the Invention of man, but the voice of God; It is the Spirit (of God who knows the minde of God) that ſaith ſo, Thus ſaith the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Quaery, <hi>Why is it ſaid from henceforth? Were not thoſe that dyed in the Lord before, happy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Some ſay the Emphaſis on this Particle, henceforth <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>q. d.</hi> Times will now be troubleſome; and as it was their bleſſedneſs that lived to the Lord, at any time to die for the Lord; ſo eſpecially it is their Bleſſedneſs to die then: It is ſome mercy to die before times of Judgement, as it is a mercy for ſome to die in times of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Others refer it to their Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs immediately after their death; that is, their Souls ſleep not in their Bodies till the Reſurrection, as ſome dreamingly affirm, they are immaterial and immortal, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

do they go out of their earthly Tabernacles, but preſently they aſcend to Heaven: It is probable that the Spirit hereby would alſo preſignifie by way of contradiction, the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Papiſts about Purgatory, as if the ſouls of good men did take that ſtage in their way to Glory: No, ſaith the Spirit, their Purgatory is in this world; here they are purified, and immediately upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the union between their ſouls and Bodies; as their Bodies are bleſſed in the hope of a Reſurrection, ſo their Souls are preſently bleſſed in poſſeſſion; thoſe that die in the Lord, are thenceforth, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately bleſſed.</p>
            <p>But I principally on this ſolemn occaſion, pitch on the laſt clauſe; <hi>And their works do follow them:</hi> Firſt, for the Explication, then for the Application.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Explication here are two Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be anſwered.</p>
            <p>Quaerie 1. <hi>What is meant by works?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are 1. <hi>Evil works,</hi> as there are evil workers: <hi>The works of the fleſh are manifeſt, uncleanneſs, idolatry, ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,</hi> Gal. 5.19, 20. At death the ſins of the godly leave them, and their Graces one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow them; there ſins ſhall be caſt not into a ſhallow river, where they may appear,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65689:9"/>
and ſwim up aloft upon the waters, but into a deep Sea of Oblivion: We muſt remember our evil works, and God will forget them; we muſt forget our good works, and God will remember them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are alſo <hi>good works,</hi> or as the Apoſtle phraſeth it, <hi>fruits;</hi> ſuch as are <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and joy, temperance and meekneſs,</hi> Gal. 5.22, 23. And theſe are thoſe works that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe that die in the Lord.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Specially works of Charity; as they ſay of <hi>Oſwald</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his liberallity to the poor, his <hi>right hand,</hi> though he was dead, withered not: Works of Charity, are in Scripture in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar maner called <hi>good works,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by way of principality and eminency, above many other works that yet are good, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the influence they have for to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and give a luſtre to all good works.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More <hi>largely:</hi> Though works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be good works, and neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet there are many good works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides works of charity: Faith is the work of God, and a good work; repentance is the work of God, and a good work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity is a Caeleſtial Orb, but not large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for all the ſtars of good works to ſhine and move in:</hi> Therefore when the Apoſtle
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65689:10"/>
ſpeaks here of (good) works, we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to underſtand in general all works that are good; not onely a ſingle Work, not onely their Charity, but their Faith, their Repentance, their Holineſs, they all do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them.</p>
            <p>Quaerie 2. <hi>What is meant by their works?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. Here is noted propriety: <hi>Their own works</hi> follow them, <hi>not the works of other men;</hi> which Criticiſm ſuggeſteth to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Abſurdity of the Papiſt, who maintains that a man may be ſo righteous, as that he may not onely merit Heaven for himſelf, but for others alſo. It was an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant ſaying of a Romiſh Phariſee, That he had done all for his own Salvation many years ago, and ſtaid in the world after that, onely to gather treaſure for others: But as a wicked man ſhall periſh by the hand of his own unbelief, ſo the Juſt ſhall live by his own faith; not the Prayers and Performances, not the duties and doings of others, but their <hi>(own)</hi> works follow them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>formal intereſt</hi> of a Believer in his works: They are his works, not becauſe he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65689:10"/>
is the fountain, but becauſe he is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Graces: Sin otherwiſe is moſt of all things ours; yet in a favorable ſenſe, as nothing is ſo much our own before we work as our will, ſo nothing is ſo much our own as our works when they are done; they cleave to us, whether as fomentations to nouriſh us, or as Corraſives to gnaw upon us, that lies in the nature of the work, but ours they are and cling to us; <hi>our Work ſeem to be more ours, then our Faith is ours;</hi> our Works are ours as we have done them, our Faith ours as we have received it: Faith is ours as our Goods are ours, Works are ours as our Children are ours, <hi>Certè nos operamur, ſed Deus operatur in nobis ut ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Querie 3. <hi>What is meant by this, that our Works are ſaid to follow us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Though the acts of Grace be tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yet their vertue is everlaſting:</hi> They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us, Notes,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their company to glory: As a Chriſtian follows his work on earth, ſo his works ſhall follow or accompany him to heaven; he goes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65689:11"/>
not out of the world naked and void of grace, as he came into the world; but he carries the garments of ſalvation, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick and Red coat of Juſtification, the intrinſick and internal white coat of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication along with him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they follow or accompany him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their <hi>inſeperability:</hi> Death may rob them of their eſtates, but death cannot plunder them of their Graces; Death may ſeparate their heads from their bodies, but ſhall never ſeperate or take their Crowns from their heads. The ambitious man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carry his honor with him; the Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſt cannot carry his Gold with him; but the godly man ſhall carry his godlineſs, his holineſs, his works with him, as the <hi>ſhadow</hi> follows the Sun, or as the ſequacious Ivy <hi>(he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera ſequax)</hi> clings to the Oak.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their Honor and Dignity of State: Grace, we ſay, is Glory begun, and Glory is Grace perfected: I, as God is glorious in holineſs, ſo a godly man is glorious in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he is glorious in Grace, his Grace is his glory. As when a Nobleman or Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor is to attend on or viſit a Prince or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, his Gentlemen in their Braveries, and his ſervants in their Liveries, wait on him to the Palace or Preſence Chamber: So a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65689:11"/>
honors God in this world, and God will honor him out of this world; he gliſters and ſhines here in his ſilks and embroyderies of humility, love and righteouſneſs; and when he is called up from this world, he goes not without his Retinue, his Graces, his works accompany or follow him to Glory <hi>one Paradice (as he ſaid) then enters into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the words thus opened. I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you with this Propoſition or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>Propoſit. <hi>That when a Chriſtian dies, his works die not with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>ſixfold attendance</hi> on a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian by his good works or graces when he leaves this world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His works follow him in reſpect of that good report they leave behinde him: It is a Judgement to have our names writ on earth, but its an honor when our perſons are in Heaven, to have a name of honor on Earth: A wicked man expires and goes out, but it is like a <hi>Tallow candle,</hi> leaving a ſtench behinde him; a righteous man expires and goes out of this world, but like a <hi>Wax candle,</hi> leaving a ſweet perfume behinde him: His works in their report follow him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In a <hi>bleſſed memory:</hi> Do well and hear
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65689:12"/>
ill is wrote on Heaven Gates, ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr; yet oftentimes do well, and hear well after we have done well, is wrote on Heaven Gates: <hi>Of you it ſhall be ſaid, this and that man was born in her:</hi> While the poor curſe the memory of the wicked, they bleſs God in the remembrance of the righteous: Some mens names are rotten before their bodies, but other mens names are alive and freſh, when their Bodies are rotten, being laid in their Graves (<hi>tantorum nominibus ſemper aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgo,</hi> ſaid the Moraliſt, of the mention of <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Lelius</hi>) The name of <hi>Lazarus</hi> is recorded, that is ſuppoſed to be his proper name; but the common name of <hi>Dives</hi> is onely related, a certain rich man, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there is all to ſignifie who he was, God thought him not worthy of further mention; G d ſhews himſelf herein contrary to the world, who have no name for the godly, poor, but <hi>ſilly wretch;</hi> or a by-name, as <hi>lame Giles.</hi> 2. God makes a memorial of the righteous, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.7. A good name, as the Father obſerves, is the godly mans heir: The names of wicked men are either altogether omitted, as in that place, or Recorded with Infamy, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is mentioned in the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of <hi>Iſrael; Pilate</hi> in the Creed, <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener</hi> in the Martyrology; but the names of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65689:12"/>
the righteous are famous: <hi>David</hi> is dead, but his zeal for God lives; <hi>David,</hi> ſaith the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>was a man after Gods own heart: Job</hi> is dead, but yet his patience for God lives; have ye not heard, or <hi>ye have heard of the patience of Job: Abel</hi> was murthered above 4000 years ago, yet his Faith is alive to this very day, <hi>he yet ſpeaketh,</hi> his tongue is out of his head, and yet his faith is not tongue-tyed? Oh, ſaith God, what a Believer was <hi>Abel!</hi> ſome render it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, paſſively is yet ſpoken of, that is, he is of <hi>bleſſed memory,</hi> his name is honorable in the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His works follow him in their report, by an happy example: A good mans perſon is gone, but his footſteps are left behinde him; when he is dead, and gone to heaven, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth the face of God in glory; his example left behinde him, is a Looking-glaſs for others to dreſs themſelves by, a Copy for others to write after: <hi>This womans charity, ſaith Chriſt, ſhall be made mention of where ever the Goſpel ſhall be preached:</hi> The Father its true dies, but yet he lives in his child that wears his image, eſpecially in a moral ſenſe, when the child imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the vertues of the father: When a friend bewailed to <hi>Epaminandas</hi>'s want of iſſue, that noble Captain replyed, That he ſhould leave two fair daughters behinde him, the Battles
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65689:13"/>
of <hi>Leuctra</hi> and <hi>Mautinea,</hi> in which his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory ſhould ſurvive: A good man never dies childleſs, his examples of Patience and integrity are his never dying off-ſpring: In this ſenſe <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe Champions that wrote for Chriſt, and dyed in the Lord, are yet alive in their words and works; <hi>And though their ſouls be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet are they inſtrumental for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſouls on Earth:</hi> As long as their Works or Writings are extant in the World, they ſhall not have done preaching to, as long as their holineſs towards, and courage for God are upon Record and publiſhed, they ſhall not have done converting of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to, or at leaſt of confirming of Saints in Chriſt, <hi>efficacior eſt vox operis, quam opus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Their works follow the Saints, many of them <hi>formally and really:</hi> Indeed they take leave of Faith and hope, they are militant Graces, and onely ſuitable to the ſtate of the Church on Earth; but Love is a <hi>Triumphant Grace,</hi> and goes along with them to Glory: and now abideth <hi>Faith, Hope, Charity, theſe three; but the greateſt of theſe is Charity,</hi> the greateſt <hi>Extenſively,</hi> Faith and Hope being more perſonal Graces, Love being communicative, rather here <hi>proten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65689:13"/>
in reſpect of duration; to ſave a man, Faith is great; in a man ſaved, Love is the greateſt: Faith, and Hope, and Repentance, go with Chriſtians vertually; as he that hath the Spirits and Extracts of Herbs, is ſaid to carry the Herbs with him, and a Merchant that turns his Lands into Pearls and Gold, is ſaid to carry his Eſtate with him; ſo the fruit and ſubſtance of Faith lives, though juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, or Faith juſtifying dyes: The Motto of <hi>Chawcer, Farewel Phyſick,</hi> may well be the Motto of a dying Chriſtian, Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel Repentance, farewel Hope: Repentance is a plank after Shipwrack, and where there is no ſea, no water, there is no need of a plank: As the Sword-bearer to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Charls,</hi> being a Proteſtant, carryed the Mace before his Maſter to the Church door, when he went to Maſs, but his conſcience would not ſuffer him to go in with him: So in a ſenſe Faith guards us to Heaven Gates, and when it hath done its office, there it leaves us: Faith follows a Chriſtian, as the ſhadow doth the Sun, from one point of the Compaſs or Dyal to another, until it comes to the Miridian, and there it leaves it; but love is a Royal Grace, an Heavenly Peer, with State and Majeſty it enters into Glory, and dwells with the King of Glory him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65689:14"/>
to all Eternity: As Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaid, when a dying, <hi>I ſhall change my place, but not my company:</hi> his Graces followed him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Their Works follow them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the comfort of them; as the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked onely leave their duties behinde them, and carry their ſins with them, ſo the godly leave their ſins behinde them, and carry their graces with them, they put off their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when they go to bed. And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. After death a childe of God is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with the ſucceſs of his works: How comfortable at the laſt day will it be, for a <hi>Maſter of a Family</hi> to preſent his ſervants at the Tribunal Bar before the Lord, and to ſay, Lord, Here am I, and my ſervants with me, that not onely wear my Livery, but alſo obeyed thy commands: For the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> that have been faithful, to preſent their flocks before the great Biſhop and Shepheard of ſouls, and to ſay, Here are the purchaſe of thy blood, the travail of our ſouls, the fruit of our labors and tears: As the Ancient ſweetly brings in the Apoſtles, like ſo many <hi>File-leaders,</hi> ſeverally bringing up their Converts to the Judgement-Seat; <hi>Peter</hi> attended with the converted <hi>Jews; John</hi> leading up the <hi>Aſiatiques; Thomas</hi> the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65689:14"/>
               <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Gentiles: Et nos hic Paſtores vocati ſumus, &amp; ibi greges non duce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus?</hi> And it is the perſwaſion of many great Divines, <hi>That the ſpiritual Fathers in Chriſt, ſhall know their children in Chriſt at that day:</hi> Their ſucceſs will advantage their comfort, and therefore it is part of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to labor for ſucceſs; though it muſt be acknowledged, that God rewards us not according to the ſucceſs of our <hi>labors</hi> properly, but according to our <hi>labors</hi> for <hi>ſucceſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let none be diſcouraged that their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works have not their ſucceſs with men; for as the good Phyſician always heals not, ſo the good Preacher always converts not: The ſucceſs of our labors is his work, not ours, and God rewards us not according to his own work (ſimply and abſtractly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) by the leave of that yet true and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous affirmation, God crowns his own works in us) but according to our works: <hi>He ſhall give to every man according to his works:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; we had better have one work writ in Heaven, then a thouſand on Earth; and though men may forget labors of love on earth, yet the comfort is, they ſhal be reminded &amp; rewarded by <hi>Chriſt in heaven;</hi> thoſe that convert ſouls,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65689:15"/>
and run like ſtars on Earth, ſhall at laſt be Crowned, and ſhine like ſtars in Heaven, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3, 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. After death, a childe of God ſhall be comforted with the Teſtimony of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: And thus,</p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>Integrity</hi> ſhall follow or accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him: Miſerable is he whoſe conſcience condemns him, though all the world acquit him; but thrice happy is he whoſe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence acquits him, though all the world ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him: A man may have hypocriſie in him, and yet be no Hypocrite; he may ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and ſleep with the fooliſh Virgins, yet be no fooliſh Virgin; while we are on this ſide our Fathers houſe, we cannot but trip and ſtumble, though we keep the way; while we are on this ſide Paradice, we cannot behold a Pomgranate that hath no rotten grain in it: This may ſupport, that if we bring our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Touch-ſtone, the Lord himſelf will never bring them to the Balance; the charge of Hypocriſie is familiar and eaſie, the proof is laborious and hard: We are not made Lord Judges of mens Conſciences, and therefore, notwithſtanding private ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we muſt forbear, and refer the cenſure of the full and final eſtate of man to God: Its the work of God to diſcover Hypocrites,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65689:15"/>
not of man; while a man goes about to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover an Hypocrite, let him beware, leſt in ſeeking to finde out one he diſcover two, the ſearched and the ſearcher: <hi>Quam immenſa eſt laetitia de recordatione tranſacti operis?</hi> Poſſibly it may be ſaid concerning many Chriſtians, who never ſtudied to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Critical Religion of the World; as it was ſaid of Father <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Venetian,</hi> becauſe men knew not how to convince him, either in his Profeſſion or Life, they had one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this common plea againſt him, <hi>That he was an Hypocrite:</hi> But what a teſtimony will <hi>Samuel</hi> bring with him at that day, to ſay in the audience of Men and Angels, <hi>Whoſe Ox have I ſtoln?</hi> For bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> to manifeſt at that day, <hi>This is the teſtimony of my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> that in godly ſimplicity I have behaved my ſelf in the world.</p>
            <p>My Beloved, get a good conſcience, for that is a <hi>thouſand witneſſes,</hi> and a thouſand witneſſes will not at that day be ſo good as a good conſcience: How amiable will the face of true Grace be then? How abominable will the vizor and counterfeit be?</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Charity and Love ſhall witneſs for him: Many have no greater ſenſible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their loving Chriſt, then by the love they bear to his ſervants that wear his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65689:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Livery, to his Children that bear his Image: But then the ſcruples of the upright ſhall be diſſolved, reſolved, and they ſhall not need ſo to puzle their brains to finde the love of the Brethren in their hearts.</p>
            <p>How refreſhing will it be then, for a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to have occaſion to ſay by way of Praiſe and Teſtimony; the Lord gave me the loaf, and I grudged not to give others the crums: God made my cup full, and I made it to run over for the relief of others: It will, I am ſure, it will be more comfortable for a man to ſay, I have been good, and I have done good in the World, then to ſay, I had (all) the goods of the World: Good works are a Treaſure, and will follow you; good and cordial Prayers are a Treaſure, and they will go before you; and Faith and Hope are a Treaſure, and they will go with you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is ſtrange to conſider, how many bad words men have for good works, as if to be charitable were to be Popiſhly affected; but if charity be Antichriſtianiſm, Chriſt is the Pope, and</hi> Rome <hi>is at</hi> Jeruſalem, Rev. 14.13. Acts 7.59. Luke 23.43. <hi>Make to your ſelves friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlaſting habitations,</hi> Luke 16.9. Not by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65689:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
way of merit, but by way of concomitancy, every acting of every Grace will ſtand us in ſtead, a charitable act as well as a repenting act: <hi>Quicquid pauperibus ſpargimus, nobis colligimus:</hi> I ſhall not impoſe on your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: But it is reported that <hi>Evagrius</hi> in <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dremus</hi> bequeathed 300 <hi>l.</hi> in his will to the poor, but took a Bond of <hi>Syneſius</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop for the payment of it in the other life, &amp; the next night after his departure, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in his ſhape, delivered in the Bond, cancell'd and fully diſcharged, ſaying, Take your Bond again, I am ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His perſeverance will follow him: It were better for a man never to ſet his hand to the plow, then to look and to go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; better never to have begun in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, then to end in Apoſtacy. Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the Crown of Grace, becauſe it is the Crowning Grace: Perſeverance is the Crown of Grace, and Heaven is the Crown of Perſeverance: Praiſe the Marriner when he is arrived at his Harbor; commend the Souldiers valour, when he hath got the day and won the field: Hold on, and <hi>hold out</hi> Faith and Prayer, ſaid the Martyr, <hi>Hold faſt that which thou haſt, that no man take thy Crown, ſaith the Lord, Revel.</hi> 3.11. How ſweet will it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65689:17"/>
be for a Believer to carry the teſtimony of his perſeverance in his conſcience to the laſt Aſſizes, to have ground to ſay, It's true Lord, I have had many infirmities, many failings, yet my heart was upright, my heart did not lay hypocriſie at my door; I confeſs, I often ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, I had almoſt faln; many a time have I offended againſt thy glory before the World, but oftner have I grieved thy gracious ſpirit in private; yet through thy grace I have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, I have fought the good fight, I have run my race; and though I have many ways forſaken thee, yet thou didſt not forſake and take thy farewel of me, thou didſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my ſins, and heal my ſoars: We cannot but be ſhot at by Satan while we are beſieged, we get many a fall and bruiſe by the world &amp; luſt; ſcarce a <hi>Jacob</hi> that wreſtleth with God, but goeth limping; yet where ſin is a Tyrant, not a King; an enemy at our backs, not a friend in our boſoms; it wil not be charged on us, ſo as to condemn, ſo as to damn us: What a comfortable ſight is it to ſee a Chriſtian to contend againſt fleſh &amp; blood in this world; to ruine with Chriſt, rather then to reign with <hi>Caeſar?</hi> to march out of the Battle, though wounded and maimed, yet with his colours flying to the Grave? If they be bleſſed that die in, how bleſſed are they that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65689:17"/>
moreover die for the Lord? <hi>Mori pro Domino, Martyrum eſt, in Domino, confeſſorum.</hi> Bern. <hi>Beatus eſt Petrus qui cruciatur, nec minus beatus eſt Johannes qui in Lecto moritur.</hi> Aret. in Loc.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, His works follow him in reſpect of Teſtimonies, <hi>ad extra,</hi> and ſo his works ſhall finde a probation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the <hi>good Angels:</hi> As they are Gods Meſſengers to us, ſo they are our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to God; the tears of repenting ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are the wine of Angels, they rejoyce in, therefore they muſt needs obſerve the converſion of ſinners: Many Actions done out of the view of men, are yet within the cognizance of Angels: The good Angels ſhall give in their teſtimony againſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and for the righteous; ſuch an one, Lord, was a Blaſphemer, a Drunkard, we can witneſs to it, we have heard him ſwear, we have ſeen him drunk; but ſuch and ſuch were attenders upon Goſpel Ordinances; were given to Prayer and Meditation, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and good works: and as far as we can judge, were not onely Profeſſors of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, but ſincere Profeſſors; were not onely called Saints, Saints by calling, but Saints indeed by Dedication and Infuſion; not onely called Chriſtians, but Chriſtians as they were called, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.10.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:65689:18"/>2. His works ſhall finde a probation from the very <hi>Divels:</hi> As at the great day, in ſome things the godly ſhall acquit the Divels (for the Divels are not always guilty; when we are filthy, <hi>we often paint the Divels blacker then they are, to make our ſelves whiter then we are</hi>) and give them their due; ſo in ſome things the Divels (as very Divels as now they are) ſhall acquit the godly. God, <hi>q. d.</hi> will then ſay to Satan, as one of old, <hi>Satan, haſt thou conſidered my ſervants, Job, David,</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> and Satan that accuſed them, while living, ſhall then as it were juſtifie them: Wiſdom is too often condemned by her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren here, but Wiſdom ſhall be juſtified by her enemies hereafter. Providence will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort this confeſſion from Divels; true Lord, they were great ſinners, but we cannot deny the truth of their repentance, and we did often tempt them, when yet they were not overcome: Thus Religion ſhall be cleared, not onely by Diveliſh men, but by Divels: The Divels will then teſtifie that wherein Gods ſervants failed, it was much, becauſe of their ſnares; that ſuch and ſuch of Gods children had lived more comfortably but that they tempted them to diſpair; had lived more righteouſly, but that they tempted them to ſcandal; had done more work for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65689:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God in his vineyard, but that they diſquieted and hindred them: <hi>Jeſus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you,</hi> ſaid the evil Spirit in the Acts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He hath a teſtimony of his good works from good men: Religion is now made a party by too too many; and men became of an opinion not to ſerve God, but to get Votes for their reputation: O what a refuge is it for the Hypocrite to flie to the applauſe and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of Gods people! to cry up others for their Heavenly-mindedneſs, that the Heavenly-minded indeed might not cry out againſt them for worldly-mindedneſs; not but that the good opinion of good men is conſiderable, but <hi>in ſe</hi> and ſeparated from goodneſs of practiſe in our ſelves, its but the varniſh of Hypocriſie: As the evil Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of an evil man maketh not a good man evil, ſo the good Opinion of a good man maketh not an evil man good: yet as God is the witneſs of our heart, ſo good men are the witneſſes of our lives: The Rabbies have a fine Proverb, That he that doth a good work, <hi>bonum opus,</hi> gets to himſelf againſt the laſt day <hi>Advocatum,</hi> an <hi>Advocate;</hi> and ſo many good works, ſo many Advocates (but Chriſt is our Advocate) but he that continues
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65689:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo many evil works as he doth, ſo many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, or ſo many Accuſers he procures againſt himſelf in Judgement: Good men will then teſtifie one for another; when Juſtice ſhall enquire what ſuch and ſuch were (not that God needs mans teſtimony, but to ſpeak to conſcience, and according to the ſubſtance of the proceſs at that day) the righteous ſhall anſwer, Lord, ſince we are called to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, we muſt needs ſay, That while ſuch were a blaſpheming thy name, a ſcoffing at thy people; we knew them to be Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and Scoffers, theſe and theſe of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were a praying, a hearing of thy Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, a mourning for ſin, they and we did comfortably and often ſerve the Lord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They ſhall have a probation from evil men: Their accuſation is not ſo conſiderable as their acquittance: Men, ſaid he, ſpeak evil of me, but they are evil men that do ſo; and an argument for us from an adverſary, is not to be neglected: though wicked men curſe the Saints while they live, yet they ſhall bleſs and juſtifie them in the day of Viſitation, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either when pangs of <hi>conſcience</hi> ſeize on them: Or,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65689:19"/>Secondly, When they come to die; as one ſaid, O that I might be <hi>Craeſus</hi> living, and <hi>Socrates</hi> dying! Or as the Proverb is, Let me live in <hi>Italy,</hi> but let me die in <hi>Spain:</hi> So <hi>Balaam,</hi> though he lived the life of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yet he loved the death of the righteous; though men live Hypocrites, yet they would die ſincere; though many live by a form of godlineſs, yet they would fain die by the power: Or,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They ſhal reſpect and honor them at the Judgement-day: Oh, will <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſay then, that I were <hi>Moſes!</hi> Wil <hi>Cain</hi> ſay, that I had been but ſuffering <hi>Abel?</hi> Who would be a Rake-hell or a Ranter then? when many of thoſe that have been Judges, ſhall be judged, and the judged (many of them I mean) ſhall be Judges; when <hi>Paul</hi> that once ſtood at the Bar, ſhall ſit on the Bench; for the Apoſtle telleth us, That the <hi>Saints ſhall judge the world:</hi> That time is a coming (though now the world judgeth the Saints, and one Saint judgeth another) that is, ſhall be, <hi>q. d.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſeſſors with Chriſt at the laſt day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to, and applauding of his Judgement of the world; when the Judge ſhall ſay to the Curſers, Go ye curſed, the Saints ſhall ſay, Amen Lord; when <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> ſhall be thrown down to Hell, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> taken
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65689:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
up to Heaven: Who would riſe in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of wrath he was born, lived and dyed in? Thoſe that now accuſe the godly for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers and Hypocrites, will then publikely confeſs their ſincerity. Chriſtians! Be not diſcouraged in your more ſtrict profeſſion of Chriſtianity; it is no matter what now they ſay of you behinde your backs, but what they ſhall be forced to ſpeak of you to your faces at that day.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Even the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> will bear a teſtimony to his works: What though all men and Angels ſhould condemn us, now God himſelf will not condemn, but acquit us; as he hath a bottle for our tears, ſo he hath a file for our Prayers, and a Book for our Works: Wicked men look on the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Gods people, their mole-hills, as mountains; their motes, as beams, as ſins of the greateſt magnitude, and on their own mountains and beams as mole-hills, and motes: Men are mercileſs in their cenſures, but God hath more equitable ſcales, and can give Grains of allowance to his Gold.</p>
            <p>Even as God ſeemed to ſtand Neuter for a time, while there was a diſpute held between <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65689:20"/>
his integrity; at length God ſteps from behinde the curtain, and pleads his cauſe: Who ſaith my ſervant <hi>Job</hi> is an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite? you charge deſperately on my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; but <hi>you have not ſpoke of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant Job hath done,</hi> Job 42.7. Gods people oft in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, ſpeak that againſt themſelves that God never ſpake; we are but Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, we are caſt out of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, theſe miſcarriages of ours have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the Covenant between God and us, are inconſiſtent with integrity or true Grace; but God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.2. <hi>knows their works,</hi> their patience, their labors of love, their gold, notwithſtanding ſome droſs, their ſincerity amidſt many failings, and will make them known to themſelves &amp; all the World at the laſt day; the Lord will ſay concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this and that man, I know them to be cleanſed by the blood of my Son, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men have caſt duſt on them: Others have ſurveyed their lives, and ſeen ſome ſpots which they themſelves have lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I know them to be Holy, and to have feared my Name: Now if God ſhall juſtifie, who ſhall condemn at that day?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:65689:21"/>Fifthly and laſtly, Their works ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them in reſpect of a guerdon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: In Scripture the word <hi>Work</hi> ſignifieth three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The very <hi>act of Labor,</hi> ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>in the Grave there is no wiſdom,</hi> no work, that is, no working for Heaven, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the <hi>effect of labor;</hi> that which is wrought we call his work, as well as the act of his labor; thus the fire will try every <hi>mans work,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the reward of a Chriſtians Labor: Work is taken for wages; it is uſual to put <hi>Prayer</hi> for the thing prayed for, or for the thing obtained by Prayer; ſo <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sa.</hi> 1.27. <hi>The Lord hath given me my petition;</hi> that is, The childe for which I did Petition. It is uſual to put ſin for the reward or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. <hi>My ſin,</hi> that is, my puniſhment for ſin, <hi>is greater then I can bear;</hi> ſo alſo its uſual to put the <hi>work,</hi> as for the reward of the work, and that, 1. <hi>In malo;</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.18. Thy way hath procured this unto thee; <hi>this is thy wickedneſs,</hi> that is, this is the reward of thy wickedneſs. 2. <hi>In bono,</hi> as in my Text, <hi>their works followed them;</hi> that is, the <hi>reward</hi> of their works; they had done their work, and now God rewards
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65689:21"/>
them through Grace: Their works die not with them, as <hi>Hortenſius his labors</hi> did: A cup of cold water ſhall be produced, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. They forget their good works; When ſaw we thee an hungry, or naked? But Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members them, inaſmuch as you did it to one of theſe little ones, you did it unto me; thoſe that have done well, ſhall have a well done; <hi>thoſe that have ſown to the Spirit ſhall of the ſpirit reap everlaſting life; Glory, and Honor, and Peace, ſhall be to every man that worketh good, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Gentile; if in this life onely we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable; as in</hi> Adam <hi>all dyed, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive;</hi> as ſure as we are gracious, ſo ſure ſhall we be glorious; as ſure as Heaven en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into a man in this world, ſo ſure ſhall that man enter into Heaven in the world to come: To be brief in this, as certainly as now the Crown of immortality and Glory ſhines in the eyes of Gods people, ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſhall it one day ſit gloriouſly on their heads: Its eaſier to tell what Heaven is not, then what it is; We may talk of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our future reward, but we ſhall never know the weight of that Crown, till we have it on our heads; the worth of that Livery, till we have it on our backs; the greatneſs
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65689:22"/>
of that Glory, till it reſt in and ſhine into our hearts: The reward of good works ſhall be great.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But why doth the Goſpel chiefly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or more apparantly note the reward of works of mercy, pity and charity, at the laſt day?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Upon four accompts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe good works are the fruits of Faith: There may be charity without Faith, but there can be no true Faith without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Eccleſiaſtick Story was wont to ſay, I like that Faith better that can be ſeen then that Faith which onely can be heard:<note place="margin">Ubi bona opera non apparent ad extra, ibi non eſt bonum opus ad intra.</note> So where there is no Charity, <hi>ad extra,</hi> without, there is no true Faith, <hi>ad intra,</hi> within: So <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> Though Faith have a preheminence, becauſe works grow out of it, and ſo Faith as the root is firſt; yet Works have the preheminence thus, both in that they include Faith (in Believers) in them, and that they diffuſe and ſpread themſelves more then Faith doth: And it is remarkable, That though Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65689:22"/>
oft to believing in this life, becauſe he would be ſure to plant and faſten that ſafely, which is the root of all, Faith: yet in the next life his proceedings are grounded on Works, and he will judge us according to our Fruits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe works are viſible demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Faith: In Titles and Conveyances where Lands are made over to us, we have Seals to our Writings, and witneſſes to our Seals; ſo here our perſons are inſtrumental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtified by our Faith (as we ordinarily ſpeak) but our Faith is juſtified by our Works.</p>
            <p>The evidence to God that our Works are good, <hi>ſcil.</hi> formally is our Faith; the evidence to men that our Faith is good, probably is our Works: Men can give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony concerning our Charity; but Faith is a ſecret, and God onely can witneſs to that: Now God, who is all Spirit, will not judge the World immediately, but by our Mediator, God-Man, that humane nature that hung on the Croſs, ſhall <hi>q. d.</hi> ſit on a Throne; the Judge then ſhall be viſible, and the Perſons to be Judged ſhall be viſible, and the publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65689:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhall in a great part be concerning things viſible too: God will ſo act at that day; as that all men ſhall ſee the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Proceſſe, <hi>he will judg, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſecret counſels, his cabinet decrees, but according to evidence, and his revealed Law.</hi> Now <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Shew me thy faith without works, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my works;</hi> this demonſtration <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> is manifeſt. Faith like the <hi>Queen of the South,</hi> comes not alone to <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſhe brings her traine after her: Faith is this Queen, let Repentance be her Uſher to go before her; and good Works, as Patience, Charity, Meekneſſe, the Court that follow her, ſo let her come to the King of Glory, in the Preſence Chamber of Jeſus Chriſt in heaven: As long as we feel thy pulſe beating, we are ſure thou liveſt; yet the beating of thy pulſe is not the cauſe why thou liveſt, but a ſigne by the effects. As Chriſt ſaid of himſelf, when the queſtion was, whether he was the Meſſias? View <hi>my works,</hi> ſaid he, they are they that <hi>teſtifie of me:</hi> So I may ſay of men, their converſations, their works teſtifie what they are: Good works before men, are good witneſſes of our faith before God. God will then examine men of thoſe things that man can bear teſtimony to.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65689:23"/>3. Becauſe men accuſed, naturally and generally <hi>appeal</hi> to their good works, by whom or by what wil the hypocrite be tried? By Gods people? No; by the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation? No; for that's a myſtery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them: but by my works will I be tryed; why then to thy works thou ſhalt go; thou boaſteſt of thy works, but where is their goodneſſe! How can thy works be good, if thou thy ſelfe the worker art e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil! The Lord likes Adverbs better then Adjectives; <hi>Benè</hi> better then <hi>Bonum.</hi> Do your works proceed from a good heart, and do they tend to a good end? Our works muſt not only materially be good (for there may be <hi>malum opus</hi> in <hi>bonâ materiâ;</hi>) but the aim and intention of our works muſt be good alſo, or elſe, notwithſtanding our good works, we are evil workers before God. And further, I believe that the meer outſide Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will then be found to have been defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in good works; in ſome or other good work: Either he will be charged for inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in getting his eſtate, with which he hath been charitable; and that's not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly charity for a man, as we ſay, to ſteal the whole loaf out of the cupboard of a poor man, and then to give him a cruſt at the door: Or as the Spaniſh Proverb is, to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65689:24"/>
ſteal a Gooſe, and ſtick down a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly, For partiality in doing good: We may obſerve, That all Cauſes are required to make an Action good, but one defective <hi>Circumſtance</hi> will render an Action bad.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Good works will then be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in for Evidence, becauſe by them we are like God: What one Evangeliſt hath, <hi>Be perfect as your heavenly Father is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi> another renders it, <hi>Be you merciful as your Heavenly Father:</hi> Some things God teacheth us by precept, other things he teacheth us by Example; as to repent by Precept, to love by Example: Now we more imitate God in following his Precepts, then in obeying his Commands: Simply ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, we are more like God in our Love, then in our Repentance; hence God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is called <hi>Love,</hi> but not Faith proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: A Believer that is a good man, a man full of compaſſion and bowels of mercy, is the moſt <hi>godly,</hi> the moſt <hi>God-like</hi> man in the world.</p>
            <p>For the Application and Concluſion of this Doctrine, That when a Believer dies, his works die not with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Hence, is by way of <hi>Caution</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65689:24"/>
good works: Good works, ſay the Papiſts on this Scripture, <hi>go before in reſpect of Merit, but follow after in reſpect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> but the words ſpeak of the Reward that follows, not of the Merit that goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; a Reward we acknowledge, Merit we deny; we ſhall be rewarded according to our good Works, but not for our good Works: It is ſufficient to merit, that merit ſufficeth not.</p>
            <p>The Antinomians ſay, Good works are not neceſſary for Salvation; they might better ſay, They are not neceſſary as to Juſtification; that is, that they Juſtifie not: He that beggeth Mercy, boaſteth not of Merit: Good works do not go before, but follow us to Heaven: The blood of Chriſt, is the golden Key to open the door of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice. It is reported, that the Doctrine of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> was, That a bare profeſſion of Faith, without a reformation in the life, was ſufficient for ſalvation. <hi>Auſtin</hi> juſtly conceives that one reaſon why <hi>James</hi> ſo prefers Works,<note place="margin">Cave non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ab operibus malis ſed etiam à bonis.</note> as to ſay, That <hi>Abraham</hi> was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by them, was, becauſe that ſome Licentiats had ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the Doctrine of Faith delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65689:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by <hi>Paul:</hi> Good works are ſuch things, as no man can be ſaved for them, and yet no man can be ſaved without them: The truth is, we are not onely not ſaved for our Works, that we are not ſo much as ſaved for our Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The greateſt degree of Faith, is not worth the leaſt or loweſt degree of Glory:</hi> It was height of Pride, that made a Jeſuit ſay, <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum gratis non accipiam;</hi> the value of Faith grows, <hi>non ex perſona credente, vel ex na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura fidei, ſed ex pacto contrahenti,</hi> not ſo much from our condition, as from Gods Covenant; <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved:</hi> There is no inconſiſtency between theſe two Propoſitions, <hi>He that believes,</hi> and <hi>he that repents ſhall be ſaved:</hi> For though we are juſtified by Faith onely, yet not by Faith alone; that is, Works juſtifie not with Faith, and Faith juſtifies not without Works: Good Works qualifie the ſubject believing, but Faith is the proper inſtrument of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Covenant of Grace: Faith is an evidence to us of our righteouſneſs before God, and Works are an evidence of the truth of our Faith before men: <hi>Out of the point of Juſtification, Works cannot be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently juſtified or commended, but in the point
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65689:25"/>
of Juſtification Works are not to be admitted:</hi> How hard is it to joyn together, what God would not have ſeperated? Faith and Works; ſo to work and repent, as if we were to be ſaved, <hi>q. d.</hi> without Faith; and ſo to believe, as if we were to be ſaved without Works: How difficult is it for a man, a moral man, to ſee the neceſſity of Faith? to cry out, What though I am righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before men, if yet I ſhould want the righteouſneſs of Chriſt before God? My righteouſneſs is but as rags, my duties but as dung, my tears need Chriſts blood: Lord! without thy free Grace, and a Plaiſter of the merits of Chriſt, notwithſtanding all my Prayers and Performances I am undone. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> well obſerves, how much the <hi>believing and the begetting Abraham differs;</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting <hi>Abraham</hi> was a worker, the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Abraham</hi> was righteous, his Faith was on Chriſt the object of Faith; and we are bleſſed, not with the working, but with the believing <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Is for the information about the aim and end of men in their Works: It is curiouſly queſtioned, whether it be not a ſordid way of obedience, for a man to eye his reward in his obedience; but it is more
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65689:26"/>
becoming a Philoſopher then a Divine (I judge) to provoke his Auditors to vertue, without the leaſt reflection of a future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>If that be true which is affirmed by many, that Grace and Glory differ not ſpecifically, but gradually; and that be true which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by all, That mans Happineſs and Gods Glory be indiſputably conjoyned in Heaven; then certainly we may have our eye to the Star, while we have our hand at the Helm; we may have one eye to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as well as the other to the Work: <hi>As it is no Prerogative act for God to damn the Hypocrite at laſt day, but an act of Juſtice, ſin being the antecedent cauſe of wrath; ſo the ſalvation of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright, will not appear to be the product onely of Gods Arbitrary Grace, but (according to his revealed truth) the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his remunerative righteouſneſs; Grace in us being, though not the cauſe, yet the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of Glory:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the Goſpel deters us from ſin, by arguments formed out of Hell, as the unquenchable fire, and the terrors of the Lord; ſo it animates us to duty, by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments made out of Heaven and Glory: How doth it embolden a Believer to ſail

            <p>Firſt, Bee importunate at the Throne of Grace, that ye may be made the <hi>workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of God, which you muſt be, before you can do the work of God. <hi>Fiamus opus Dei, ut facimus opus Dei;</hi> your natures muſt be renewed before you can doe new actions: A bad man can never Theologically do good works, morally he may, but he that doth a moral work only, ſhall have a moral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward only; as the wheele turns round, not to the end it may be made round: But on the contrary, as the ſtemms muſt firſt be grafted on the ſtock, before they can bring forth fruit, ſo we muſt be Branches in Chriſt, united to, and made one with him, before we can be fruitful in good works.</p>
            <p>The Church in the Canticles is deſcribed no where by the beauty of her <hi>hands</hi> or fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, though oft by the beauty of other parts of her body, becauſe a Chriſtian ſhould abound in good works, and yet in ſilence without boaſting. Or Secondly, becauſe it is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65689:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt alone, that works all our works in us and Grace, is not our Creature, but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of Chriſt: <hi>Bona opera non praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt Juſtificandum, ſed ſequntur Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If you would have your good works to follow you, ſend them before you: Now Repent, now Believe, and hereafter you ſhall have the reward of your Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and of your Faith; and as for Charity, part with that you cannot keep, that you may obtain that you cannot loſe: When the world ſhall leave you, your good works ſhall follow you, your gracious actions; your good works are an inexhauſtible fountain, that ſhall never be dryed up, a durable ſpring that ſhall never fail; they are acts of time, ſhort in performance, yet eternal in their recompence: <hi>Non tranſeunt opera nostra, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut tranſire videntur, ſed velut aeternitatis ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina jaciuntur:</hi> Though they are ſown in this world, they ſhall ſpring in the next; that which you lay out for Chriſt on earth, you lay up for your ſelves in Heaven; the hand of the poor is the Treaſury, the Gazophyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and by charity, in a <hi>Goſpel ſenſe,</hi> you make your Maker your Debter; and ſurely if thou be the Creditor of the

Almighty, it will not be long ere he come out of thy Books: How fooliſh are they that fear to loſe their wealth by giving it, and fear not to loſe themſelves by keeping it? <hi>He that lays up his Gold may be a good Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, but he that lays it out is a good ſteward.</hi> Merchants traffick thither with a commodity where 'tis precious, in regard of ſcarcity: We do not buy Wines in <hi>England</hi> to carry them to <hi>France;</hi> Spices in <hi>France</hi> to carry them to the <hi>Indies:</hi> ſo for labor and work, repentance and mortification, there is none of them in Heaven, there is Peace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the favor of God indeed: Their works, in my Text, go with them, they dare not go without their fraught: <hi>A Merchant without his Commodity, hath but a ſorry well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:</hi> God will ask men that arrive at Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Gates, <hi>ubi opera? Rev.</hi> 22.12. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall be according to our works: Thou haſt riches here, and here be objects that need thy riches, the poor; in Heaven there are riches enough, but no poor; therefore by faith in Chriſt, make over to them thy monies in this world, that by Bill of Exchange thou mayeſt receive it in the world to come; that onely you carry with you, which you ſend before you: Do good while it is in your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, relieve the oppreſſed, ſuccor the fatherleſs, while your Eſtates are your own, when you
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65689:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are dead, your riches belong to others; one light carryed before a man, is more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then twenty carryed after him: In your compaſſion to the diſtreſſed, or for pious uſes, let your hands be your Executors, and your eyes your Overſeers; and that I may not be miſtaken, let your Charity have theſe two Qualifications.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let your works be done in Faith; as without works we cannot profit men, ſo without Faith we cannot pleaſe God; we muſt be marryed to Chriſt, or our children are not Legitimate, our works are not right: All our ſurviving out of the Ark, will not ſave us from the deluge of Gods wrath: As <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Father, here is the Altar and the wood, but <hi>where is the ſacrifice?</hi> ſo at laſt day, when you ſhall knock at Gods door, and ſeek to enter, and hold up your Lamps and cry, Lord! we are Virgins, we are Chriſtians, we were hoſpitable and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable according to thy command, let our neighbors be witneſſes of our good works; but, will the Lord reply, True, here are your duties and your works, but where is my grace of Faith? Are theſe a ſatisfaction to my Juſtice? where is my <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of my Son to plead for you? My Beloved, <hi>There ſeems to be leſs glory in Faith,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65689:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then in any other Grace, it ſeemed but a ſorry Grace,</hi> a Grace of no great vertue; Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is acceptable, becauſe it honors God; Charity is noble, becauſe it profits men; Thankfulneſs is melodious, becauſe its the tune of Angels: Other works ſeem to make God a Debter, to give as it were ſomething to God; but <hi>ad quid fides?</hi> What is Faith good for? Yes, it is good for every good purpoſe, its the root of all the Graces, its the richeſt Grace, becauſe its the inriching Grace; if Faith go before, Works will follow: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Chriſtus non eſt boni operis fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum, ibi nullum eſt bonum aedificium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As works of Charity muſt be qualified with Faith, (or elſe our <hi>haec ego feci, haec ego feci,</hi> this and that have I done, are but <hi>faeces</hi> dregs, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith aptly) ſo they muſt be qualified with ſincerity; while the peny is in the hand, let Gods glory be in the heart: Your lights muſt ſhine, ſo that men ſeeing your good works, may glorifie God; but not that men ſhould ſee your works, and glorifie you, and cry you up and down, There goes a charitable man, there goes a great worker: Men judge of the heart by the work, but God judgeth of the work by the heart: At the Judgement Bar <hi>it will be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi> before God, if the matter of the work
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65689:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be ill to plead the goodneſs of the heart; to ſay, Though I was a common Blaſphemer of thy name, a common neglecter of holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet I had an honeſt heart; <hi>ſo when the heart is naught, there is no pleading before God the goodneſs of the work;</hi> you faſted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and were charitable; Will the Lord ſay (as he did to the Jews) but was it for my Glory, for the exaltation of my name? out of the ſenſe of my love? <hi>Cains</hi> works had been good, if <hi>Cains</hi> heart had not been evil: How ſad will it be for ſome, to behold at the laſt day the mites of others to be received, and their own talents rejected; the good works of many to leave them, and their evil works onely to follow them? <hi>Chriſtus opera noſtra, non tam actibus, quam finibus penſat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Work while you have time to work; caſt up your accompts, before you come to give up your accompts, or your accompts will caſt up you: How vainly do many talk of working for Heaven, when they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the place of working, to the place of rewarding, of doing the greateſt work, to repent, to believe, when they have leaſt ſtrength to do them, of turning their ſouls to God, when they can hardly turn their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies on their beds? Believe it, believe it Chriſtians! its too much for one man,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65689:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that at one time, to look after a ſick ſoul, and a ſick body together; if ever you would have your works to follow you when dead, follow you your works while you live, be earneſt in ſelf-examination, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in making your Calling and Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſure; like wiſe Virgins, <hi>Get not onely lamps into your hands, but oyl alſo into your lamps:</hi> The Grave is a place for reſting from out works, not of working for reſt: The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Bar is a place for the diſtribution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, not for the diſpenſation of Mercy; <hi>now or never, now if ever,</hi> work out your ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, get the one thing neceſſary: <hi>Surgunt impii non ad judicium, ſed ad condemnationem:</hi> The wiſe man tells us, There is no work to be done in the Grave, that's not a ſhop to work in, but a Grave to reſt in; <hi>thats not a time for the killing of the worm of guilt in our ſouls, when the worms are gnawing and feeding on our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:</hi> God will not ſend Prophets to the grave, nor ſet up a Pulpit in Hell for the Preaching of ſalvation to the dead or damned.</p>
            <p>Laſtly I might adde, Take examples from Gods Oracles, and from Providence, follow them that have ſo followed Chriſt; as ever you would have your perſons follow Gods ſervants to glory, let your faith &amp; love follow their examples that are left behinde on earth.</p>

of the Sabbath both publique and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate were over:</hi> She was able to comport her ſelf with the higheſt, yet ſhe uſually condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both in diſcourſe and behavior, to the loweſt and meaneſt of Gods children: She brought forth much fruit, and made but a little noiſe: She had much glory by her Face (but as Reverend <hi>Hall</hi> ſays of <hi>Moſes</hi>) in her proportion, ſhe had more glory by her vail. I never heard ſhe was reconciled to any, for indeed, I never heard ſhe had an enemy: The Miniſtry have loſt a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Favorer; the Poor a Phyſician; her endeared Husband, the beſt Companion in this troubleſome world. And that which is the Crown of all, ſhe acknowledged the imperfection of her own Duties, and the neceſſity of Chriſts righteouſneſs. To conclude, ſhe was of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe few that lived and dyed in honour; ſhe hath done her work, and is gone to ſleep.</p>
